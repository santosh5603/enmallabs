## What is Enma Labs?

**Enma Labs** is an enterprise-grade AI platform built specifically for Chartered Accountant (CA) firms. At its core is **Enma** — an AI Chief of Staff that connects directly to Telegram and handles the full spectrum of CA operational work: reading and reconciling client invoices, processing bank statements, answering tax queries, and onboarding new clients through a cryptographically secure handshake — all in real time, with full legal compliance.

This repository contains the **frontend marketing and authentication website** for Enma Labs — the landing page, registration flow, login, and demo booking system.

## Key Features

### AI Document Processing
Clients forward invoices and bank statements directly to Enma via Telegram. Enma performs OCR extraction and tax reconciliation automatically — eliminating manual data entry entirely.

### Secure Token-Based Telegram Onboarding
Every client onboarding uses a cryptographically secure, one-time token with a 30-minute expiry window. Raw firm IDs are never exposed in any URL or deep link. The token is invalidated immediately after first use.

### Enterprise Security Architecture (V2)
The V2 architecture was rebuilt from the ground up to eliminate an IDOR vulnerability present in earlier versions. Firm authentication now flows through a secure token handshake rather than raw ID transmission.

### Legal DPA Compliance
Before any data flows, every CA firm must digitally sign a legally binding Data Processing Agreement (DPA). Consent is timestamped, IP-logged, and stored server-side — creating a permanent, auditable legal record.

### Zero LLM Training Guarantee
All uploaded client documents — invoices, bank statements, tax queries — are used strictly for the firm's authorized operations. Client data is never used to train any public AI model.

### Real-Time Tax Query Handling
Clients send GST questions, document requests, and reconciliation queries directly to Enma on Telegram. Responses are generated and delivered instantly — freeing CA teams from repetitive manual work.

## Security Architecture (V2)

The V2 security model follows a token-based Telegram authentication handshake:

```
1. CA firm registers → DPA consent logged server-side (timestamp + IP)
2. Backend generates: tok_{secrets.token_urlsafe(16)} — expires in 30 min
3. Token embedded in Telegram deep link — raw firm ID never exposed
4. On /start command received → token validated → Telegram ID bound to firm
5. Token immediately invalidated after single use
```

**Attack surfaces eliminated:**
- ✅ IDOR via raw firm ID in deep links — patched
- ✅ Replay attacks — one-time token + 30-min expiry
- ✅ Unsigned consent — server-side DPA logging with audit trail
- ✅ Cross-firm data leakage — logical isolation per firm

---

## Backend Integration

The frontend communicates with a FastAPI + PostgreSQL backend via the following key endpoint:

```
POST /api/v1/auth/consent
Body: { firm_id: string }
Returns: { token: string }
```

The backend also processes a secure `/start` intercept on the n8n Telegram bridge to validate tokens and bind Telegram IDs to CA firm accounts.

> Backend repository and n8n workflow configurations are maintained separately.

## Data & Privacy

- Client documents are used **exclusively** for OCR extraction, tax reconciliation, and authorized CA operations
- All data is logically isolated per CA firm
- All documents are encrypted at rest
- No client data is ever used to train AI models
- DPA acceptance is cryptographically logged before any data flows
